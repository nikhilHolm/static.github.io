      WS has different types of security credentials depending on how you want
      to access the cloud account. For example, you need a user name and
      password to sign in to the AWS Management Console and you need access keys
      to make programmatic calls to AWS or validating the user to create
      resources via terraform. If you don’t have an AWS account, you can check
      how to create an AWS free tier account. There are mainly two types of
      access through which you can access your AWS account: Console access
      Programmatic access Check also: Free AWS Training Let’s see the difference
      between both these accesses. Console Access There are 2 ways in which a
      user can access the AWS console. You can either log in through a root user
      or an IAM user. When you first create an AWS account, you will be asked to
      specify an email address for the account and a password for the root user.
      To sign in to your AWS account as the root user, you need to provide the
      same email address and password. The root user can sign in to the AWS
      Management Console and change the account name, email address, and
      password. A root user has access to all the resources and permissions
      available. Whereas IAM users are created by the root user or an IAM
      administrator within the AWS account. To log in through the IAM user, you
      should have the account alias or 12-digit AWS account ID, the IAM user
      name, and the password for the IAM user. If you somehow forget the
      password for your IAM user, contact your IAM administrator or the account
      owner. If your IAM administrator gave you permissions to manage your own
      AWS credentials, then you can change your password periodically, which is
      a security best practice, using the Security Credentials page. Also Check:

      Programmatic Access You must create and provide AWS access keys to make
      programmatic calls to AWS or to use the AWS Command Line Interface or AWS
      Tools for PowerShell. When you create your access keys, you will get the
      access key ID (for example, AKIAJIPU77TQL5LB6OIB) and the secret access
      key (for example, 8Mw77pe6Ua9wr56f6lr069rDPTDWeUvV0q6ZS+6N) as a set. You
      can assign up to two access keys per user (root user or IAM user). Note:
      The secret access key is available for download only when you create it.
      If you don’t download your secret access key or if you lose it, you must
      create a new one. Read More : About Amazon Route 53. Steps to Create
      Access Keys 1) Go to the AWS management console, click on your Profile
      name and then click on My Security Credentials. Security CredentialsAlso

      Access Keys and select Create New Access Key. Secret KeyGo through this
      AWS Blog to get a clear understanding of what is aws fargate? 3) Click on
      Show Access Key and save the access key and secret access key. Note: Make
      sure you save these as once you close this window, you won’t be able to
      view them. Once you have the access and secret keys you can use these to
      create resources using terraform. To check how you can create a VM in AWS
      using terraform, visit our blog on Automate AWS Virtual Machine using
      Terraform. Best Practices For Managing AWS Access Keys Here are some of
      the best practices that you must follow while managing AWS access keys:
      Never create an account access key: One of the best ways to protect your
      account is to not create access keys for your AWS account root user unless
      required. Instead, the recommended best practice is to create one or more
      AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and grant those IAM users
      the necessary permissions and use them for everyday interaction with AWS.
      Use temporary security credentials instead of long-term access keys:
      Long-term access keys that never expire are not often required. Instead,
      you can create IAM roles and generate temporary security credentials.
      Temporary security credentials consist of an access key ID and a secret
      access key, but they also include a security token that indicates when the
      credentials expire. Manage IAM user access keys properly: If you must
      create access keys for programmatic access to AWS, create them for IAM
      users, granting the users only the permissions they require. Don’t embed
      access keys directly into code: Put access keys in either the AWS
      Credentials file or Environment Variables. Check Out: AWS Elastic Load
